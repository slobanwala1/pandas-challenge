**Note** The tables on github do not look as clean as on the jupyter notebook IDE which is why I've attached images to the readme incase user does not want to clone them locally and see them on an ide. The file is located inside my_submission directory. It is called [HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb](https://github.com/slobanwala1/pandas-challenge/blob/main/my_submission/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb). The Images are located in [Resources/Images](https://github.com/slobanwala1/pandas-challenge/tree/main/my_submission/HeroesOfPymoli/Resources/Images).
